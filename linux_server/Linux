	> while I'm on the computer with RSA key, then I log in as one of the users that's not root, if I type exit, then I can log out of that user, and I will be root again.  This is weird because I can't do su because there is no password, so authentication fails... I think this kinda a weird scenario.  Might try to add a password to root so that I can get to root from other compuers
		> ok added a pswd to root, so now it works, but still might be a cool trick to do if someone is working to just type exit
