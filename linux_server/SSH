> ip addr : gives ip address

> on the computer you want to connect to you need to make an ssh server by installing openssh-server, or sshd
	> apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client
	> apt-get install sshd, I think this works.  Haven't tested it yet though

> ssh username@ip-address
	> this is how you connect to a remote computer

> scp <source> <destination>
	> secure copy
		> allows you to copy a file from, or to a remote computer
	> /path/to/filels username@ip_address:/path/to/file
		> make sure the remote path you specify, is a path that the user you are logging in as has access to.
	> the machine that you are going to connect to needs to be set up as an ssh server
		> apt-get install sshd

> RSA key
	> ssh-keygen : generates RSA public/private key pair
		> it will ask you where to save the keys
		> public key is then shared with remote machine
	> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub : where the public key is located
	> I put my public RSA key in the home directory for both root and zsmith so that I can log in as either

> how to enable or disable passwords:
	> use vim to open /etc/ssh/sshd_config
		> set following line to yes: ChallengeResponseAuthentication
		> restart ssh: sudo service sshd restart
