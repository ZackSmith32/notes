Experience Overview

1.  I have a B.S. in Economics from Carnegie Mellon

2.  Worked as a product management analyst for Farmers insurance.  I created the statistical analysis that supported rate changes.  It was a great first work expereince where I learned a lot about the professional application of my skills.  Most importantly I learned that insurance wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

3.  After Farmers I started working at connexity as a senior analyst.  I went to connexity to try to get more into the technolog world.  My job there was to analyze the results of customer experience surveys and advise clients on where they could improve their web sites that would have the highest return in net promoter score.

4.  Left connexity to start Mvmnt with an engineer friend of mine from CMU.  Our business was a platform where social media influencers could build websites from a template, focusing on features that would allow them to monetize their fan base.  In the end the creators didn't have enough extra time to devote to our platform on top of all the other platforms, and we didn't get the traction from creators that we needed.

5.  After closing Mvmnt I continued studying web development and heard about 42.

6.  Came to 42, which turned my world upside down.  I had been learning coding from the top down, and 42 teaches it from the bottom up.  Learning C has given me a much stronger understanding of how applications work, how they interact with each other, and interact with their platform.

2. Building on that I understand the needs of a Data Engineers' customers
