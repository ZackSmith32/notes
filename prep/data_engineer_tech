ETL : Extract Transform Load
Amazon
	> Databases
		> Redshift : datawarehouse (see databases)
			> structured data
			> very fast

	> Streams
		> Kinesis
			> streams realtime data
				> click streams
				> logs
			> allows you to do operations and monitor data streams in real time


Hadoop (Apache) aka HDFS
	> HDFS : Hadoop Distributed File System
		> highly fault tolerant (hence Distributed)
		> master/slave architecture
	
	> open source
	> good for storing lots of data (many petabytes)
		> can store all types of data
		> runs on comodity hardware
	> is redundant
	> no data size limits
	> need to use separate software to effectively query
		> spark
		> mapreduce : the OG software, but supposedly inferior to spark
		> Pig


Databases
	> cassandra (Apache)
		> NoSQL database

	> redshift
		> amazon database
		> has data limit around 1.5 petabytes
		> faster than hadoop
		> uses Postgres query syntax
		> requires you to use other amazon services to provide data such as S3 or Dynamo

Analysis Engines
	> spark : competitor to mapreduce
		> easier to work with
			> has API that works with many of the big name languages
			> writing complex queries, do not have to do it iterively as with mapreduce

	> mapreduce : oldschool
