Rules for Headers

#define
	after define everything is added to the file until the endif
		put # before things that need #
		and for things that don't need it, like prototyping dont
		use it

	need to double define for some reaseon
		#ifndef FT_ABS_H
		# define FT_ABS_H

	name the endif and define the same name a the file
		#ifndef FT_ABS_H
		# define FT_ABS_H

	examples of functions that are defined in headers
		you cannot use "if" in these definitions
		not sure if yout can do multiple lines?
		what do you need func(x) #x for?

		# define ABS(Value) ((Value < 0) ? -(Value) : Value)
		# define EVEN(x) (!(x % 2))
