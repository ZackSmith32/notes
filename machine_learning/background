> supervised ML
	> for training data you know what the correct answer is (i.e. this is an image of a cat)
	> learn from labeled training data

	> classification or regression models
		> classification attempts to draw a line the separates two groups
		> regression draws a line that best represents a set of data

> cost function: tells us how well a line fits data
	> low : better fit
	> high : worse fit
	> types
		> mean squared error

	> gradient descent : how to minimize the cost function

> machine learning algorithms
	> perceptron : neural networks
	> logistic regression
