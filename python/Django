Django

// prepend 'python' to all commands

> ./manage.py startapp <name>
	> starts a subapp
		> aka creating a new file with boilierplate shit

> run server
	> manage.py runserver

> set up database
	> python manage.py migrate
		> look in settings, installed apps, then figure out which tables each app (in settings) needs.
	> whenever you make a change to your models
		> python manage.py makemigrations
		> python manage.py migrate

> open django shell
	> manage.py shell
	> can be used to view sqlite database

> setting up postgres
	> lots of tutorials to do basic set up
	> things that were tough.. I think I don't know for some reason took me a while to figure out
		> getting the migration to work
			> manage.py makemigrations <python appname (like the one from settings)>
			> manage.py migrate
	> other than that seems like almost identical code for accessing postgres as with sqlite
	> pgadmin: gui for database
	> psql : included command line interface for postgres
