Header File Notes

Errors
	duplicate symbol error:
		> this happens when you define something in the header, 
		and include it in multiple source files
		> one solution is to define something in a seperate header file and include it in just the c fiile you need it in
		> also see globals
	Undefined symbols error
		> maybe you didn't include all the files when you compiled
		
Globals
	extern
		> declare in header: extern int g_global
		> then in a seperate c file define the global.  You will need to include the type when you define it, even though that was apart of the declaration in the header..?
		> this will prevent the multiple inclusion compiler error

#define : used for macros
	> define goes through your program and any place it finds a the term you defined, it replaces it with what you defined it as

	> object like
		> generally used to name a parameter (a number) that is going to be used a lot, think BUFFSIZE
