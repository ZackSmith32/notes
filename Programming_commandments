Programming Commandments

1. Always fully set up your dev environment.  Think about what you are going to need in the future

2. Always set up your architecture (this is kinda like psudo-coding) first

3. Test your code as you go.  Not TDD, but make sure the shit works.  If you build up your tests as you go you will have a robust tests as opposed to flimsy tests

4. Sudo code

5. Talk to other people and get feedback about your strategy, this will help you understand if you are missing any elements of the problem.

6. Challenge yourself to think of all the ways to break your program
	> your program should not break

7. If possible parse data into your data structure, then test for bad input data.  Testing while parsing confuses your functions

8. Don't stack up arrays to deep, makes it difficult to unwind

9. Never push incomplete code to a repo that more than just you contributes to.  Forget that, never push incomplete code.
