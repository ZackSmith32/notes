Python Algorithm Notes

Set : used for testing membership and removing duplicates
	> x.union(y) : x | y
	> x.intersection(y) : x & y
	> x.difference(y) : -
	> x.symetric_difference(y) : x ^ y
	
	> can be converted to a list : list(set(y))
	> can be ordered and implicitly turned into a list : sorted(set(x))
	> creating a set
		> myset = {1, 5, 56}
		> myset = set([5, 67, 0, 22, 45, 5])

input :
	raw_input() : reads one line
		> brings the input in as a string
		
		> useful fucntions with raw_input
			> split()
				> splits on delimiter in parens, default is white space
			> strip()
				> removes whitespace from beginning and end
			> map(int, arr[])
				> applies functino to all members of the provided data


	input() : reads one line
		> will try to guess what your input type is and evaluate it
			> res = input()
			>>>> 5 + 2
			> res = 12


from xyz import method
	> from __future__ import division
		> future is methods that are available in python 3
		> in future "/" returns decimals (real value)
			> if you want integer divis you need to use "//"
		

math stuff
	> ** : power
	> ^  : bitwise xor
	> // : division and disgard remainder

arrays
	> arr.append(xxx)
	> built in functions
		> max(arr)
		> len(arr)
		> type()
	> methods
		> arr.indx['xyz'] : returns index of 'xyz'

	> arr.sort()
		> sorts the list in place
	> sorted(arr)
		> returns a sorted copy of an array
		> works on all itterables
		> key : a way to add a funciton, OR select an sub-element of each element to sort on
			> for both sort and sorted : 
			> key=str.toLower()
				> I think str is an arbitrary name used to represent the current element
			> key=lambda rand_name: rand_name[1] 
				> sorts based on the second ([1]) value of each element in the list
	> when you set another variable = to an existing array, it is simply pointing to the same memory
		> therefore when you update the first array, the variable that you set equal to that is also changed
		> which is to say a = b does NOT create a copy
	> y = list(x) : creates a copy of x



scope
	> array outside of function can get changed in function and it will be reflected outside of function
