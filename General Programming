General Programming

Interpreted vs. Compiled language
	> interpreted
		> execute instructions directly without previously copling a program into machine language
		> interpreter translates code into a sequence of already compiled subroutines 
		> Java, python, ruby

Funtional programming

Object Oriented programming

Kernel

lambda functions: heard about them at amazon echo talk

digital ocean
	> cloud computing
	> provide servers

Languages
	> clojure
	> lisp
	> go
	> rust : a low level language invented by mozilla to take the dangerous parts of memory management out of c, and keeping the speed of a low level language.
	> golang
	> what is "ruby" on rails?

Dynamic Programming 

> polymorphism
	> Polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).
	> closely related to object oriented programming, classes and inheritence
	> ex: a float multiplied by an integer

> caching
	> saving frequently used information in a temporary store
	> browser saves the information for recently viewed web pages so that when you visit them again it can load them faster.
	> some methods for revmoving items from cache when it is full
		> LFU : least frequently used
		> LRU : Least Reently Used
		> MRU : Most Recently Used

> SQL vs NoSQL
	> NoSql : document based storage
		> no strict rules for storing data
		> simpler architecture
	> SQL
		> hard data requirements, reduces data inconsistency
		> data integrity
			> can issue put in rules to make sure that an entry in one column must correspond to an entry in another column

	> Which is faster?
		> depends on how you design your data stores.  But NoSQL is simpler, and does not require joins
